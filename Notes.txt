TypeScript is a Super set of javascript.
TypeScript is all about type safety.
What TypeScript does:
Static Checking means when were we write the code the state of the code is 
directly checked by javascript.(Analyze the code as we type it).
TypeScript is transpiled to javascript.
(TypeScript is a developement tool Your project still runs JS).
TypeScript Types:
Number,String,Boolean,Null,undefined,Void,Object,Array,Tuples....
Any,Never,unknown
we can't assign integer or float separately to a variable we can use a common datatype such as number.
